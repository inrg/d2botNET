# d2botNET - Diablo 2 Botting Engine

## Contents
- Core source files (0.5.0)
- Pathing (2.0.3, not most recent version)
- BotOS (version doesnt matter, it was experimental)

## Why did I upload this?

I had been looking for the source code for a long time, and I finally came across it - although not the latest version - 
and since the source was never published years ago as it was meant to be, I have done
so now.

Wow, the amount of work the team and all the plugin developers put into this was truly amazing. It was a fun time, I learned a lot, and made a lot of awesome friends.

I am trying to find the official developer list and will post it here when I find it.
