HOW TO COMPILE A BOT
--------------------

INTRODUCTION
------------

This document is intended to help you compile and run a simple bot named
HelloDiablo.  This assumes you have downloaded version 0.3.1 of botNET,
that you have C# .net, and Diablo II LOD.


BASICS
------

The base botNET directories should install itself under your Diablo II
directory as shown:

<Diablo II>
    botNET
        Assemblies
            Libraries
        Source
            botnet.core.dll
            Examples
                HelloDiablo

Regardless of where your Diablo II directory is located, when we refer to
it, we'll use <Diablo II>. The HelloDiablo directory may likewise be
referred to as the <HelloDiablo> directory.

C# source code will be compiled against the .net and botNET libraries to
create a dll.  This dll can be loaded as a module by botNET.


WALKTHROUGH
-----------

1) Start your copy of Visual C#.

2) Open the the HelloDiablo solution file:
    "<Diablo II>\botNET\Source\Examples\HelloDiablo\HelloDiablo.sln" .

3) Build the solution using the menu Build > Build Solution.

4) The compiled module/assembly/dll should now exist as
    "<HelloDiablo>\bin\Debug\HelloDiablo.dll" .

    4a) If you wish to compile without debug features use the menu
        Build > Configuration Manager to select Release instead of Debug.
        If you do so, your compiled dll will now reside in Release
        instead of Debug.

5) Copy this dll to the <Diablo II>\botNET\Assemblies directory.  It is
    from here that botNET expects to find loadable modules.

6) Start Diablo II, preferably in a window (for development ease). To
    load in a window, you may modify the shortcut for Diablo II to include
    the -w flag.  For example:
        "C:\Diablo II\Diablo II.exe" -w

7) Run the botNET loader "<Diablo II>\botNET\botNETLoader.exe". From the
    main screen.  This is the screen with the version number on it
    (v 1.10) and the selection buttons for "SINGLE PLAYER", "BATTLENET",
    "OTHER MULTIPLAYER", "EXIT DIABLO II", and a few other buttons.

8) Enter a single player game with any character.  When the game starts,
    you should see the text "botNET" followed by the current version
    number.  If you don't see this, botNET is not loaded.  See the botNET
    forums or IRC channel for assistance as the next steps will not work
    without botNET loaded.

9) Load your HelloDiablo module in game by opening a chat window and
    entering ".load HelloDiablo".

10) Start your module by entering ".start" in a chat window.  Once you do
    this, the text "Hello Diablo!" should appear in the upper left corner
    notification area along with the phrase ".Start -> Starting default
    DLL".  If you saw the "Hello Diablo!" text, congratulations!  You've
    successfully compiled and run a botNET module!


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

If you are having trouble compiling, a compiled version of HelloDiablo
should already be provided in the Assemblies directory.  You can test your
ability to load botNET by jumping to step six in the walkthrough.

If you are having trouble loading botNET, the D2Loader version of the
Diablo II.exe may be required.
